Creating a visualization of automatic gradient computation and GPU performance upgrades. 

Understanding the basic models like pytorch and how they work.

added BCE + sigmoid, BCE + sigmoid trains the network by maximizing the probability (likelihood) of the observed labels under a Bernoulli model, the thing i learnt in the MLPR class

Performing gradient checking and understanding the importance of it. Double cheking gradient descent mathematically.
